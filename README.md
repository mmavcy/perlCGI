perlCGI
=======
A University assignment. 
The task was to write a CGI script, to produce a form.
A folder was provided containing a big number of datasheets in .doc format, .pdf format, or both.
The form should let the user specify the folder's path and select the desired formats to list and count.
The draft report contains some comments about the implementation.
