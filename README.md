perlCGI
=======
A University assignment. 
A folder was provided containing a big number of datasheets in .doc format, .pdf format, or both.
The task was to write a CGI script, to produce a form that lets the user specify the folder's path and select the desired formats to list and count.
The draft report contains some comments about the implementation.
